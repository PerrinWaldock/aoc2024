d24p2 notes

for a basic adder, expect to have 2X XOR gates, 2X AND gates, 1X OR gate for each input pair -> 271 gates
        3x intermediate pairs per input pair: 135
        io: 2*45 +46 = 136
        271 gates
        so, there are an extra 312 - 271 = 41 wires stuck in there somewhere...
    
solving by hand shows that dnt and z15 need to be fixed to get z15 to work
	can we assume that all are working

    looks like z15 isn't connected to an overflow wire and z45 isn't connected to x45 or y45
    4 pairs need swap:
        1? mystery overflow to z15
            this must be caused by inputs being duplicated, so probably need two different inputs
                try all combinations of swapping two wires from outside of the set of gates to inside of the set of gates?
                want to see what fixes the dependencies
        2? z45 from x45 and y45
        what is one remaining?
    
    functions:
        generate which wires connect to which gates
        find dependencies of every wire, not just the outputs
    
    adder fix:
        y15 AND x15 -> z15; gate needs to go to the OR that feeds the z16 carry
            need to find the dependencies of EVERY wire to isolate options
                this gate's output connects to
        x15 XOR y15 -> dvj, dvj needs to be connected to the XOR gate that produces z15 and is fed from the x14, y14 carry
            currently:
                vhr XOR dvj -> dnt
                vhr AND dvj -> ckf
                hdb OR rkf -> vhr
                    rfk is the z14carry ?
        how to write a function:
            try to go through the tree to check gates, inputs are as expected
                if something not as expected, try swapping outputs until it is as expected?

        
        need to find:
            swap z15: wires that is an input to the z15 carry
                z15 carry must be produced from OR with inputs from two AND gates
                    one AND: x15 AND y15
                    one AND: (x15 XOR y15) AND z14Carry
                        z14 carry must be vhr
                            hdb OR rkf -> vhr

                current z15 carry must be fed from dependencies of z16 to avoid problems
                    jpj XOR scq -> z16
                        x16 XOR y16 -> scq

                        jpj AND scq -> swj : jpj IS the z15 carry
                        dnt OR ckf -> jpj
                            need z15 swapped with dnt or ckf?
            swap dvj: wires that is an output of an XOR with a dependencies of x14, y14 but not x15, y15
 


                
    nominal:
        TODO see if can write a program that traverses the circuit, adds a bit of the adder
            e.g. start with 
        y01 XOR x01 -> nsc
        y01 AND x01 -> bkg
        rpj AND nsc -> gpt
        rpj XOR nsc -> z01
        gpt OR bkg -> gsh

check each pair of inputs
	are xn and yn connected to xor and and
		is xor connected to xor and and
			is xor connected to output
			is and connected to or
				or's output connected to next carry
				is and's other input equal to the carry
		is and connected to above or
